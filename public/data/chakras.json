In yoga philosophy, there are seven chakras that are commonly discussed, each located at a different point along the spine. Each chakra is said to have its own corresponding color, element, and sound, and certain yoga practices such as asana, pranayama, and meditation are believed to help activate and balance the chakras. By working with the chakras, practitioners aim to promote physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Here is an overview of each chakra:",
